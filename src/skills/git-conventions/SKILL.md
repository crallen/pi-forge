# Git Conventions

Rules for clean version control history: Conventional Commits format, branching model, and commit hygiene.

## Conventional Commits

Every commit message must follow this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | When to use | Version bump |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature or capability | minor |
| `fix` | A bug fix | patch |
| `docs` | Documentation-only changes | none |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons (no code change) | none |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change | none |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | patch |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests | none |
| `build` | Build system or external dependency changes | none |
| `ci` | CI configuration changes | none |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks that don't modify src or test | none |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit | varies |

### Rules

1. **Subject line:** `<type>(scope): description` — max 72 characters, lowercase, imperative mood, no trailing period.
2. **Scope** (optional): The area of the codebase affected. Use consistent scope names within a project (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `db`).
3. **Body** (optional): Explain WHY the change was made. Wrap at 72 characters. Separate from subject with a blank line.
4. **Footer** (optional): Reference issues (`Closes #42`), note breaking changes, or add metadata.
5. **Breaking changes:** Add `!` after type/scope (`feat!: remove legacy API`) AND/OR add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer with migration instructions.

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login with Google provider

Adds Google as an OAuth2 identity provider alongside the existing
GitHub provider. Users can now link their Google account from the
settings page.

Closes #128
```

```
fix: prevent race condition in session cleanup

The session cleanup goroutine could access the session map
concurrently with request handlers. Use sync.RWMutex instead
of the unsynchronized map access.
```

```
feat!: change API response format to JSON:API spec

BREAKING CHANGE: All API endpoints now return responses in JSON:API
format. The previous flat JSON format is no longer supported.
Clients must update their response parsing logic.
```

```
chore: update dependencies to latest patch versions
```

## Branching Model

### Branch Naming

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

Examples:
- `feat/user-auth`
- `fix/null-pointer-login`
- `chore/update-deps`
- `docs/api-reference`
- `release/v1.2.0`

### Branch Rules

- `main` / `master` is always deployable. Never commit directly to it.
- Feature branches branch from and merge back to the main development branch.
- Delete branches after merging.
- Keep branches short-lived. Long-lived branches cause merge conflicts.

## Commit Hygiene

- One logical change per commit. Atomic commits are easier to review, revert, and bisect.
- Don't mix formatting changes with functional changes.
- Don't commit generated files, build artifacts, or IDE configuration.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or private keys.
- If you need to fixup a recent commit, use `git commit --fixup` and squash before merging.
