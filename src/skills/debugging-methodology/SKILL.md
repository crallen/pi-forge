# Debugging Methodology

A phased workflow for investigating bugs end-to-end: reproduce the problem, gather evidence, test hypotheses, find the root cause, and verify the fix. Follow the phases in order — don't skip ahead to fixing before you understand the problem.

## Phase 1: Reproduce

Before anything else, reproduce the bug reliably.

1. **Get the exact reproduction steps** from the bug report or user.
2. **Reproduce it yourself.** If you can't reproduce it, you can't verify a fix.
3. **Find the minimal reproduction** — strip away everything unnecessary.
4. **Note the environment:** OS, runtime version, dependencies, configuration.

If you cannot reproduce the bug:
- Check if it's environment-specific (OS, version, configuration)
- Check if it's timing-dependent (race condition, timeout, load-dependent)
- Check if it's state-dependent (corrupt data, stale cache, accumulated state)
- Add logging/instrumentation and wait for it to recur

## Phase 2: Gather Evidence

Collect information before forming theories.

**Read error output carefully:**
- Stack traces tell you the call chain. Read from bottom to top.
- Error messages often contain the exact cause. Don't gloss over them.
- Log timestamps reveal ordering and timing issues.

**Check recent changes:**
```bash
git log --oneline -20           # Recent commits
git log --oneline --all -20     # Including other branches
git diff HEAD~5                 # Changes in last 5 commits
git bisect start                # Binary search for breaking commit
```

**Inspect runtime state:**
- Add targeted logging at key decision points (input values, branch taken, return values).
- Check configuration values at runtime — are they what you expect?
- Inspect database state, file contents, environment variables.

**Check external dependencies:**
- Are external services responding? Check health endpoints.
- Are dependency versions what you expect? Check lock files.
- Has an external API changed its contract?

## Phase 3: Form Hypotheses

Based on the evidence, list possible causes ranked by likelihood.

**Common root cause categories:**

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Input handling | Unexpected nil/null, wrong type, missing field, encoding issue |
| State management | Stale cache, race condition, leaked state between requests |
| Logic error | Off-by-one, wrong operator, inverted condition, missing case |
| Resource issue | Connection pool exhaustion, memory leak, file descriptor leak |
| Dependency | Version mismatch, API contract change, transitive dependency conflict |
| Configuration | Wrong environment, missing env var, incorrect feature flag |
| Timing | Race condition, timeout too short, clock skew, retry storm |

For each hypothesis:
1. What the hypothesis is
2. What evidence supports it
3. What evidence would confirm or rule it out

## Phase 4: Test Hypotheses

Test each hypothesis systematically, starting with the most likely.

- **Add targeted assertions or logging** to confirm or deny each hypothesis.
- **Change one thing at a time.** If you change multiple things, you won't know which fixed it.
- **Record what you tested and the result.** This prevents re-testing the same thing.

**Elimination techniques:**
- **Binary search (bisect):** Narrow the problem space by half at each step. Works for code history (`git bisect`) and code paths.
- **Substitution:** Replace a suspected component with a known-good version. If the bug disappears, you've found the culprit.
- **Isolation:** Remove components until the bug disappears (or add components until it appears).

## Phase 5: Fix and Verify

Once you've identified the root cause:

1. **Implement the minimal fix** that addresses the root cause. Resist refactoring nearby code in the same change.
2. **Verify the fix** resolves the original reproduction case.
3. **Check for variants** — search the codebase for similar patterns that might have the same bug.
4. **Add a regression test** that would catch this bug if reintroduced.
5. **Run the full test suite** to confirm the fix doesn't break anything else.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Shotgun debugging:** Changing things randomly hoping something works.
- **Fixing symptoms:** Adding a nil check without understanding why the value is nil.
- **Blame-driven debugging:** Assuming a specific component is at fault without evidence.
- **Tunnel vision:** Getting fixated on one hypothesis and ignoring contradicting evidence.
- **Skipping reproduction:** Trying to fix a bug you can't reproduce.
